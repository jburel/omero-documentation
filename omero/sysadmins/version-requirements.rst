Summary of changes for OMERO 5.6
================================

We aim to support OMERO on the environments specified below, based
on the availability of support by upstream developers and operating
system distributions.
This applies over the lifetime of the |current_version| release and includes
security support.
Support is limited to those environments on which OMERO is
routinely tested.

This page details the minimum version requirements for the current
(|current_version|) release.

It is intended to provide a roadmap in order that sysadmins may
plan ahead and ensure that prerequisites are in place for future upgrades.

Operating system support
========================

The following subsections detail the versions of each operating system
which are supported by both its upstream developers (for security and
general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and server deployment.


Linux (CentOS and RHEL)
-----------------------

    * - `Rocky Linux 9 <https://endoflife.date/rocky-linux>`__
      - Jul 2022
      - May 2032
      - |Recommended|


RHEL 9/Rocky Linux 9 are supported at present. Given the long life
of enterprise releases, we intend to support only the latest release
at any given time or else it ties us into very old dependencies.

Linux (Ubuntu)
--------------

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Version
      - Release date
      - Supported until

      - |Deprecated|
    * - 22.04 LTS
      - Apr 2022
      - Apr 2032
      - |Recommended|


Only the LTS releases are supported due to resource limitations upon
CI and testing. Only the last LTS release is supported. There is currently no CI testing
for any version.

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

Client support only.
See `blog post explanation <https://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/deployment/2016/03/22/windows-support/>`_

MacOS X
-------

MacOS X is typically suited only to client use, not serious server
deployment, although the server can be expected to run on versions with
current security support for testing purposes.


Dependencies
============

The following subsections detail the versions of each dependency
needed by OMERO which are supported by both its upstream developers
(for security and general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and
server and client deployment.

.. note::
    Versions in brackets are in development distributions and may
    change without notice.

The PostgreSQL project provides `packages

therefore distribution support is not necessary.
